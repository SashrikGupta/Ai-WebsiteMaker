# Gemini LLM Website Generator

This project utilizes a fine-tuned version of the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) trained specifically on Gemini's API documentation. The application is a full-stack, AI-powered website generator with a React frontend interface. It allows users to input a custom prompt, and based on that, the AI will generate a fully functional website. The website created can include different functionalities, depending on the prompt.

For example, you can ask the AI to create a website that generates stories, handles forms, or even interacts with APIsâ€”all driven by the capabilities of the Gemini LLM.
